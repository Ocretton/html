      <h1>Activities</h1>
      <p>I love doing activities like going to Disneyland, especially now since it's been easier to get the Magic Keys. Spending that precious time I have with my girlfriend makes it even better. Experiencing moments like laughter, sadness in times of reflection, or even the happiest moments; I cherish every single one of those because she makes those better. Going to the computer store to upgrade my gear is also very fun to me as this allows me to learn more about computers since the workers there have a workstation, and you can speak to them about anything computer-related.</p>
