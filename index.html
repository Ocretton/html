    <main>
        <p>I am Ernesto Negrete a 3rd year college student majoring in CS. I currently am still in the process of looking for my main language of code and so far this has been pretty simple. I have been all over the place when it comes to finding what it is I want to major since the very beginning. I truly believe I have found what I want to do and that is coding wether that is web page development or software creation. This skill has caught my eye and so far has been extremely helpful. One thing I would say I really like about it is that it has made me a faster typer than what I used to be which is a great thing for me.</p>
